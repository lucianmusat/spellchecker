# Spellchecker

## A small project I started to learn Rust. It should be a text box where you input a text and it will return a spellchecked version. I don't have any idea what it will turn out to be in the end, we'll see.


## TODO

 [ ] Turn into a service that uses REST api
 [ ] Implement simple frontend
 [ ] Run it live
