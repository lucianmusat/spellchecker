# Spellchecker

### What is it?

A small project I started to learn Rust. It should be a text box where you input a text and it will return a spellchecked version. I don't have any idea what it will turn out to be in the end, we'll see.


### TODO

- [X] Turn into a service that uses REST api
- [X] Implement simple frontend
- [ ] Handle punctuation
- [ ] Run it live
- [ ] Add tests
